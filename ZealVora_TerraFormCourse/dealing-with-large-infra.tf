/*

when you have a large infrastructure, you will face issues realted to API limits of the provider
-> you switch to smaller configs where each can be applied indepententl
when you already did that, and still not enough you can -target=resource to specify resource
or you can turn off -refresh=false, so in the beginning it won't check already planned configs
